ECET 3640 - Introduction to Systems Engineering and Robotics

This robot is designed to autonomously differentiate between four different types of material, retrieve them, and place them in the appropriate receptacles. The materials are differentiated by shape and color (Nuts/Sleeves, Red/Black). Materials of different color are not to touch or the facility is assumed to be destroyed. Robots will perform their duties two at a time, each responsible for one side of the field. Each side will contain drop locations for each type of one color, and the robots will have to transfer materials of the other side's color to the robot on the other side. The pieces of material will be randomly distributed.

 Platform: BeagleBone Black Rev. C
